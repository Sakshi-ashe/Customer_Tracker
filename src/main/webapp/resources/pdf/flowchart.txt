CustomerDAO (data access object/helper class with Hibernate API does intercation wiht db ,
we dont use Main.app save(session) anymore instead we use methods in DAO like getCust. DeleteCust etc)

For hibernate, our DAO needs a hibernate SessionFactory and then 
Session Factory actually needs a data source

These dependencies will be bind by DI.
we hv already injected Data source in SF in config file
now we hv to inject SF in Dao
